# Adwani x Rich — Claude Instructions

## FIRST THING EVERY SESSION
1. Run `git config user.name` to find out who is currently working
2. Run `git log --all --pretty=format:"%h %an: %s (%ar)" -30` to get recent history
3. Find the last commits made by the OTHER collaborator (not the current user) and give a brief 2-3 sentence summary of what they did and when. Keep it casual.

## What This Is
A collaborative workspace between Rich (richardisho) and Jon (corleoneshow) for multiple content and ecommerce projects:

1. **AI Influencer** — SFW AI-generated social media content (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter)
2. **Podcast Clips** — Famous podcast clips for YouTube Shorts/TikTok
3. **TikTok Commerce** — Product content and sales via TikTok Shop
4. **Dropshipping** — Ecommerce stores

## Collaborators
- **Jon Adwani** — corleoneshow on GitHub
- **Rich Isho** — richardisho on GitHub, richardisho@gmail.com

## Repo Structure

## Key Rules
- NEVER commit generated images, videos, or large files — these go to Google Drive only
- Always pull before starting work (`git pull`)
- Check project-specific READMEs for workflow details

## Branch Naming
- `richie/feature-name` — Richie's branches
- `jon/feature-name` — Jon's branches
- `shared/feature-name` — collaborative features either person can work on

## First-Time Setup (after cloning)
Run once to install git hooks that block accidental image/video commits:
```bash
bash scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

## Google Drive
Shared folder under "Adwani Technologies": https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fl7aoTQ5EK_FowpB90CoPVGT3XOA1Yki
